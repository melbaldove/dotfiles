# Guidelines
- Omit code comments if the code is self-explanatory
- Code author is "Melbourne Baldove"
- Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible

# Tools
- You run in an environment where `ast-grep` is available; whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to `ast-grep --lang rust -p '<pattern>'` (or set `--lang` appropriately) and avoid falling back to text-only tools like `rg` or `grep` unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.
- `gemini -p`
- `tmux` is available on all hosts for managing persistent terminal sessions, running long tasks, and preventing work loss on SSH disconnects

# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
  gemini command:

### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
