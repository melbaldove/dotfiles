#+TITLE: Restic Backup Architecture
#+DATE: 2025-07-13
#+AUTHOR: Infrastructure Documentation

* Overview

This document outlines the restic backup architecture for the dotfiles infrastructure, providing automated, encrypted, and deduplicated backups from Newton (production server) to local Hetzner volume storage.

* Architecture

** Source: Newton (10.0.1.2)
- Production server hosting critical business applications
- Startup network segment
- Services requiring backup:
  - Twenty CRM (PostgreSQL + Redis)
  - Ghost CMS (MySQL)
  - Outline Wiki (shared PostgreSQL)
  - SSL certificates
  - Configuration secrets

** Destination: Local Hetzner Volume
- Local storage mounted on Newton server
- Dedicated volume for backup repository
- Direct filesystem access for optimal performance
- No network dependencies or cross-host connectivity required

* Data Classification

** Critical Data (Daily Backup)
*** Databases
- PostgreSQL: Twenty CRM customer data, Outline wiki content
- MySQL: Ghost CMS blog posts and media
- Redis: Session data and background job queues

*** Application Data
- Docker volumes - All persistent application data:
  - =ghost_ghost-content= - Ghost CMS uploads, themes, and media
  - =ghost_db-data= - Ghost MySQL database files
  - =twenty_db-data= - PostgreSQL database for Twenty CRM and Outline
  - =twenty_server-local-data= - Twenty CRM local file uploads
  - =outline_outline-data= - Outline wiki attachments and data
- =/var/lib/acme/= - SSL certificates (auto-renewed by ACME)

*** Docker Volumes Location
- =/var/lib/docker/volumes/= - All Docker named volumes listed above

** System Data (Weekly Backup)
- System configurations
- Docker compose states
- Nginx configurations

* Backup Strategy

** Backup Approach
- Direct backup of Docker volumes containing database files
- No intermediate SQL dumps - simpler and faster
- Consistent snapshots via restic's deduplication
- Backup during low-traffic hours (2 AM)

** Backup Execution
1. Restic snapshots all Docker volumes directly
2. Verify backup integrity
3. No temporary files or cleanup needed

** Post-Backup Operations
1. Backup verification via =restic check=
2. Prune old snapshots per retention policy
3. Report backup status to monitoring

* Repository Configuration

** Repository Location
- Local: =/var/lib/restic-backups/newton/=
- Repository type: Local filesystem
- Encryption: AES-256 with repository password

** Access Method
- Direct filesystem access on Newton
- No network connectivity required
- Repository path: =/var/lib/restic-backups/newton=

** Security
- Repository password stored in agenix secrets
- Local filesystem permissions for access control
- Backup repository encrypted at rest
- Data stored on separate Hetzner infrastructure for offsite backup
- Note: agenix secrets in =/run/agenix.d/= are runtime-only (ramfs) and don't need backup

* Retention Policy

** Snapshot Retention
- Keep last 7 daily backups
- Keep last 4 weekly backups (Sundays)
- Keep last 12 monthly backups (1st of month)
- Keep last 2 yearly backups (January 1st)

** Pruning Schedule
- Daily after backup completion
- Remove snapshots not matching retention rules
- Verify repository integrity after pruning

* Monitoring and Alerting

** Success Metrics
- Backup completion status
- Backup duration and size
- Repository integrity status
- Available storage space

** Alert Conditions
- Backup failure or timeout
- Repository corruption detected
- Storage space below threshold
- Local volume mount issues

** Integration
- Prometheus metrics via node exporter
- Log shipping to Loki via promtail
- Status notifications via configured channels

* Disaster Recovery

** Recovery Scenarios
1. Single file/directory restoration
2. Database point-in-time recovery
3. Full system restoration
4. Cross-platform restoration

** Recovery Procedures
1. List available snapshots: =restic snapshots=
2. Mount snapshot for browsing: =restic mount=
3. Restore specific paths: =restic restore=
4. Database restoration from dumps

** Testing
- Monthly restore tests of critical data
- Quarterly full restore simulation
- Annual disaster recovery drill

* Implementation Files

** Module Structure
- =modules/system/linux/restic-backup.nix= - Main NixOS module
- =secrets/restic-password.age= - Encrypted repository password
- =secrets/secrets.nix= - Secret configuration

** Configuration
- Host-specific backup settings in =hosts/newton/=
- Local volume mount configuration
- Systemd services and timers for automation
