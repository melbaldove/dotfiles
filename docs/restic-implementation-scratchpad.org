#+DATE: 2025-07-13
#+AUTHOR: Infrastructure Documentation
#+DESCRIPTION: Append-only log of actions, findings, and caveats

* 2025-07-13 Initial Planning

** Actions Taken
- Searched codebase for existing backup configurations
  - Found only manual Loki backup reference in docs
  - No automated backup system exists
  
- Analyzed Newton host configuration
  - Identified all Docker containers and volumes
  - Found services: Twenty CRM, Ghost CMS, Outline Wiki
  - Located Docker volumes under =/var/lib/docker/volumes/=
  
- SSH'd to Newton to verify actual paths
  - Confirmed Docker volume names and locations
  - Found ACME certificates at =/var/lib/acme/=
  - Discovered agenix secrets are runtime-only in =/run/agenix.d/= (ramfs)

- Analyzed Einstein as backup destination
  - Has external storage at =/mnt/media= (NTFS)
  - Runs media server (potential I/O conflict)
  - Acts as VPN gateway between networks

** Key Findings
- Ghost content is NOT at =/var/lib/ghost/content=
  - Actually in Docker volume =ghost_ghost-content=
  - All data is in Docker volumes
  
- Agenix secrets don't need backup
  - They're in ramfs (=/run/agenix.d/=)
  - Already stored encrypted in git repo
  
- Network topology:
  - Newton (10.0.1.2) on startup network
  - Einstein (10.0.0.2) on personal network
  - Connected via WireGuard through Shannon

** Design Decisions
- Simplified backup strategy: skip database dumps
  - Originally planned to dump databases before backup
  - Decided to backup Docker volumes directly instead
  - Simpler, faster, less error-prone
  - Restore is just volume restore + container restart

- Backup paths finalized:
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/ghost_ghost-content=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/ghost_db-data=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/twenty_db-data=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/twenty_server-local-data=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/outline_outline-data=
  - =/var/lib/acme/= (SSL certificates)

** Documentation Created
- =restic-backup-architecture.org= - High-level design
- =restic-implementation-guide.org= - Step-by-step implementation
- =restic-backup-procedures.org= - Operational procedures
- All updated to reflect volume-only backup strategy

** Caveats and Considerations
- Einstein storage is NTFS (may affect permissions)
- Need to schedule around media server I/O
- Must ensure Docker volumes aren't locked during backup
- Redis data might be ephemeral (verify if backup needed)
- Retention policy needs monitoring to prevent storage exhaustion

** Next Steps
- Begin actual implementation starting with NixOS module
- Test backup/restore thoroughly before production deployment
- Set up monitoring and alerting

* 2025-07-13 Module Implementation

** Actions Taken
- Created =modules/system/linux/restic-backup.nix=
  - Comprehensive NixOS module with all required options
  - Includes systemd service and timer
  - Security hardening with systemd sandboxing
  - Automatic repository initialization
  - Prometheus metrics export for monitoring
  - SSH configuration for backup user

** Module Features
- Configurable repository location and credentials
- Flexible path selection with exclude patterns
- Retention policy configuration
- Automated timer with randomized delay
- Repository integrity checks after each backup
- Metrics export for monitoring integration

** Design Decisions
- User/group creation with docker group membership
- Systemd security hardening (PrivateTmp, ProtectSystem, etc.)
- Automatic repository initialization if not exists
- Integrated metrics export to prometheus node exporter
- SSH config managed via activation script

** Next Implementation Steps
- Update secrets configuration
- Configure Newton and Einstein hosts
- Generate SSH keys and test connectivity

* 2025-07-13 Minimal Module Rewrite

** Actions Taken
- Rewrote module to be minimal (50 lines vs 200+)
- Removed all extra features:
  - No user creation (will run as root)
  - No SSH configuration
  - No metrics export
  - No retention policy
  - No repository initialization
  - No security hardening
  
** Minimal Features
- Basic systemd service and timer
- Daily backups with persistence
- Environment variables for repository and password
- Simple path backup command

** Note
- This is truly minimal - will need manual setup for:
  - SSH keys
  - Repository initialization
  - Retention/pruning
  - Monitoring

* 2025-07-13 Added Requested Features

** Actions Taken
1. Added backup user to restic module:
   - Created restic system user and group
   - Added docker group membership for volume access
   - Service now runs as restic user
   
2. Configured Einstein for backup repository:
   - Added backup system user and group
   - Created systemd tmpfiles rules for backup directories
   - Prepared SSH authorized keys (key to be generated)
   
3. Implemented retention in restic module:
   - Added pruneOpts configuration option
   - Default retention: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly, 2 yearly
   - Integrated forget --prune into backup script

** Module Updates
- Still minimal but now includes:
  - User management
  - Retention policy
  - Prune after backup
- Total lines: ~77 (still compact)

** Next Steps
- Generate SSH key on Newton
- Add public key to Einstein's backup user
- Configure Newton to use the module
- Test repository initialization

* 2025-07-13 Secret Management Implementation

** Actions Taken
- Updated =secrets/secrets.nix= to include restic password
- Secret accessible by both newton and einstein
- User manually generated encrypted secret file
- Configured agenix secret access in restic module:
  - Owner: restic user
  - Group: restic group  
  - Mode: 0400 (read-only for owner)
  
** Module Updates
- Added age.secrets.restic-password configuration
- Secret will be available at runtime in =/run/agenix/restic-password=
- Module can now reference =config.age.secrets.restic-password.path=

** Status
- Secret management complete
- Module ready for deployment
- Both hosts can decrypt the repository password

* 2025-07-13 Repository Setup Implementation

** Actions Taken
1. Simplified SSH key management approach:
   - Removed sshKey option from module (was too complex)
   - Removed SSH key setup activation script from module
   - Configured Newton to generate its own SSH key via activation script
   
2. Newton SSH key configuration:
   - Added activation script to generate /var/lib/restic/.ssh/id_backup
   - Key generated only if it doesn't exist
   - Proper ownership and permissions set (restic:restic, 600)
   - Comment: "newton-backup"
   
3. Einstein backup user ready:
   - Backup user and group configured
   - SSH authorized_keys placeholder prepared
   - Backup directories created via systemd tmpfiles
   
4. Repository initialization:
   - Added auto-initialization to backup script
   - Repository init only runs if snapshots command fails
   - No manual intervention needed

** Next Steps After Deployment
1. Deploy Newton and Einstein configurations
2. Copy public key: `ssh newton cat /var/lib/restic/.ssh/id_backup.pub`
3. Add public key to Einstein's backup user authorized_keys
4. Test SSH connectivity: `ssh newton sudo -u restic ssh backup@einstein`
5. Test backup execution

** Status
- Repository setup configuration complete
- Ready for deployment and testing
- SSH key will be auto-generated on first boot

* 2025-07-13 Code Review Issues Identified

** Critical Issues Found
1. Manual key exchange process breaks declarative nature
2. Race condition between Newton key generation and Einstein deployment
3. Hardcoded paths scattered across files
4. Missing error handling and validation
5. Inconsistent ownership (restic vs backup users)
6. Security concerns with root activation scripts

** Issues to Fix
- Manual intervention required for key exchange
- No ordering guarantees between hosts
- Hardcoded /var/lib/restic/.ssh/id_backup paths
- No validation of /mnt/media mount
- User mismatch between newton (restic) and einstein (backup)
- Missing error checking in SSH key generation

** Recommended Solutions
1. Use agenix for SSH key management instead of runtime generation
2. Add mount validation and assertions
3. Create shared backup configuration module
4. Use consistent user names across hosts
5. Add proper error handling and validation
6. Eliminate manual post-deployment steps

** Status: NEEDS REFACTORING
Current approach has fundamental issues that need addressing before deployment.
