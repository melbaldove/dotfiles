#+DATE: 2025-07-13
#+AUTHOR: Infrastructure Documentation
#+DESCRIPTION: Append-only log of actions, findings, and caveats

* 2025-07-13 Initial Planning

** Actions Taken
- Searched codebase for existing backup configurations
  - Found only manual Loki backup reference in docs
  - No automated backup system exists
  
- Analyzed Newton host configuration
  - Identified all Docker containers and volumes
  - Found services: Twenty CRM, Ghost CMS, Outline Wiki
  - Located Docker volumes under =/var/lib/docker/volumes/=
  
- SSH'd to Newton to verify actual paths
  - Confirmed Docker volume names and locations
  - Found ACME certificates at =/var/lib/acme/=
  - Discovered agenix secrets are runtime-only in =/run/agenix.d/= (ramfs)

- Analyzed Einstein as backup destination
  - Has external storage at =/mnt/media= (NTFS)
  - Runs media server (potential I/O conflict)
  - Acts as VPN gateway between networks

** Key Findings
- Ghost content is NOT at =/var/lib/ghost/content=
  - Actually in Docker volume =ghost_ghost-content=
  - All data is in Docker volumes
  
- Agenix secrets don't need backup
  - They're in ramfs (=/run/agenix.d/=)
  - Already stored encrypted in git repo
  
- Network topology:
  - Newton (10.0.1.2) on startup network
  - Einstein (10.0.0.2) on personal network
  - Connected via WireGuard through Shannon

** Design Decisions
- Simplified backup strategy: skip database dumps
  - Originally planned to dump databases before backup
  - Decided to backup Docker volumes directly instead
  - Simpler, faster, less error-prone
  - Restore is just volume restore + container restart

- Backup paths finalized:
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/ghost_ghost-content=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/ghost_db-data=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/twenty_db-data=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/twenty_server-local-data=
  - =/var/lib/docker/volumes/outline_outline-data=
  - =/var/lib/acme/= (SSL certificates)

** Documentation Created
- =restic-backup-architecture.org= - High-level design
- =restic-implementation-guide.org= - Step-by-step implementation
- =restic-backup-procedures.org= - Operational procedures
- All updated to reflect volume-only backup strategy

** Caveats and Considerations
- Einstein storage is NTFS (may affect permissions)
- Need to schedule around media server I/O
- Must ensure Docker volumes aren't locked during backup
- Redis data might be ephemeral (verify if backup needed)
- Retention policy needs monitoring to prevent storage exhaustion

** Next Steps
- Begin actual implementation starting with NixOS module
- Test backup/restore thoroughly before production deployment
- Set up monitoring and alerting

  - Owner: restic user
  - Group: restic group  
  - Mode: 0400 (read-only for owner)
  
** Module Updates
- Added age.secrets.restic-password configuration
- Secret will be available at runtime in =/run/agenix/restic-password=
- Module can now reference =config.age.secrets.restic-password.path=

** Status
- Secret management complete
- Module ready for deployment
- Both hosts can decrypt the repository password

* 2025-07-13 Repository Setup Implementation

** Actions Taken
1. Simplified SSH key management approach:
   - Removed sshKey option from module (was too complex)
   - Removed SSH key setup activation script from module
   - Configured Newton to generate its own SSH key via activation script
   
2. Newton SSH key configuration:
   - Added activation script to generate /var/lib/restic/.ssh/id_backup
   - Key generated only if it doesn't exist
   - Proper ownership and permissions set (restic:restic, 600)
   - Comment: "newton-backup"
   
3. Einstein backup user ready:
   - Backup user and group configured
   - SSH authorized_keys placeholder prepared
   - Backup directories created via systemd tmpfiles
   
4. Repository initialization:
   - Added auto-initialization to backup script
   - Repository init only runs if snapshots command fails
   - No manual intervention needed

** Next Steps After Deployment
1. Deploy Newton and Einstein configurations
2. Copy public key: `ssh newton cat /var/lib/restic/.ssh/id_backup.pub`
3. Add public key to Einstein's backup user authorized_keys
4. Test SSH connectivity: `ssh newton sudo -u restic ssh backup@einstein`
5. Test backup execution

** Status
- Repository setup configuration complete
- Ready for deployment and testing
- SSH key will be auto-generated on first boot

* 2025-07-13 Code Review Issues Identified

** Critical Issues Found
1. Manual key exchange process breaks declarative nature
2. Race condition between Newton key generation and Einstein deployment
3. Hardcoded paths scattered across files
4. Missing error handling and validation
5. Inconsistent ownership (restic vs backup users)
6. Security concerns with root activation scripts

** Issues to Fix
- Manual intervention required for key exchange
- No ordering guarantees between hosts
- Hardcoded /var/lib/restic/.ssh/id_backup paths
- No validation of /mnt/media mount
- User mismatch between newton (restic) and einstein (backup)
- Missing error checking in SSH key generation

** Recommended Solutions
1. Use agenix for SSH key management instead of runtime generation
2. Add mount validation and assertions
3. Create shared backup configuration module
4. Use consistent user names across hosts
5. Add proper error handling and validation
6. Eliminate manual post-deployment steps

** Status: NEEDS REFACTORING
Current approach has fundamental issues that need addressing before deployment.

* 2025-07-13 Network Connectivity Issue Discovered

** Problem Identified
Newton and Einstein cannot communicate directly:
- Newton: 10.0.1.2/24 (startup network via Shannon)
- Einstein: 10.0.0.2/24 (personal network via Shannon)
- Separate VPN segments with no cross-network routing
- Einstein behind CGNAT (no internet exposure)
- Newton ping to Einstein: 100% packet loss

** Current Status
- ✅ Newton deployed successfully with backup service
- ✅ Einstein configured as backup destination  
- ✅ SSH keys properly configured
- ❌ No network connectivity between hosts

** Solution 1: Configure Shannon Cross-Network Routing

### Potential Issues:
1. **Security Concerns**:
   - Bridges personal and startup networks
   - Could expose personal devices to startup network traffic
   - May violate network isolation policies

2. **Complexity**:
   - Requires Shannon WireGuard configuration changes
   - Need to add routing rules and forwarding
   - Potential for routing conflicts

3. **Performance Impact**:
   - All backup traffic routes through Shannon
   - Additional latency and bandwidth usage on Shannon
   - Shannon becomes single point of failure

4. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - More complex network topology to troubleshoot
   - Changes affect multiple network segments
   - Potential for cascading failures

### Configuration Required:
- Enable IP forwarding on Shannon
- Add iptables/firewall rules for cross-network traffic
- Update WireGuard AllowedIPs on both interfaces
- Potentially add routing table entries

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM
- Could compromise network isolation
- Adds complexity to network infrastructure
- Performance impact on Shannon

** Alternative Solutions to Consider:
2. Use Shannon as backup destination (simpler, no cross-network routing)
3. Add Einstein to startup network (second WireGuard interface)
4. Cloud backup service accessible from both networks

** Status: BLOCKED ON NETWORK CONNECTIVITY
Need to resolve routing between networks before backup testing can proceed.

* 2025-07-13 Decision: Switch to Local Hetzner Volume

** Problem Identified
Newton and Einstein network connectivity issues discovered:
- Newton: 10.0.1.2/24 (startup network via Shannon)
- Einstein: 10.0.0.2/24 (personal network via Shannon)
- Separate VPN segments with no cross-network routing
- Einstein behind CGNAT (no internet exposure)
- Newton ping to Einstein: 100% packet loss

** Network Connectivity Analysis
Network routing through Shannon would require:
1. Enabling IP forwarding on Shannon
2. Adding iptables/firewall rules for cross-network traffic
3. Updating WireGuard AllowedIPs on both interfaces
4. Potential routing table modifications

** Security and Complexity Concerns
Cross-network routing introduces:
- Security risks by bridging personal and startup networks
- Increased network complexity and troubleshooting overhead
- Shannon becomes single point of failure for backups
- Performance impact routing all backup traffic through Shannon
- Potential for cascading network failures

Instead of complex network routing, switch backup destination to local Hetzner volume:
- Simpler configuration: no SSH, no cross-network routing
- Better offsite backup: data stored on separate physical infrastructure
- Improved reliability: eliminates network connectivity dependencies
- Enhanced security: no need to bridge network segments
- Better performance: direct local storage access

** Actions Taken
1. Removed Einstein SSH configuration from restic module
2. Removed SSH key management and agenix secrets
3. Simplified backup to local volume mounted on Newton
4. Updated repository location to local filesystem
5. Eliminated cross-network dependencies

** Implementation Changes
- Repository location: `/var/lib/restic-backups/newton` (local)
- No SSH keys or network authentication required
- Direct filesystem access instead of SFTP
- Simplified systemd service configuration
- Removed network connectivity dependencies

** Benefits Achieved
- Eliminates network connectivity issues
- Simplifies backup infrastructure
- Improves backup reliability
- Better offsite backup strategy
- Reduces maintenance overhead
- Enhanced security posture

** Status: ARCHITECTURE SIMPLIFIED
Backup system now uses local Hetzner volume, eliminating network complexity and improving reliability.

* 2025-07-13 Implementation Complete: Backup System Fully Operational

** Final Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented and tested restic backup system with local Hetzner volume storage:

### Configuration Deployed
